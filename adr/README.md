# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the dim
project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made
along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short noun phrase (e.g., "Explicit Dimension Types")
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that motivates this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult because of this
  decision?
